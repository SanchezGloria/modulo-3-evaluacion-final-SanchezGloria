#Directory of Rick and Morty Characters#

:page_facing_up: The exercise consists of the development of a website that contains a list of characters from Rick and Morty, in which you can filter and see the details of each character. The website is created in React.

The website contains the list of characters from Rick and Morty, using the API which provides us with the information of the first 20 characters that appear in the series.

:zap: Under the logo there is a search bar, in which you can write the name of the character either in upper case or lower case. While inputting a name, only the characters that contain the typed letters in that order will remain on the page.

:zap: When you click on the card of a character, their information will appear in full screen. In order to do that, we use React router. On the screen of character details, as well as their photo, we can see their name, species, planet of origin, the number of episodes the character appears in and if they are dead or alive. The URL of the character detail page is shareable.

:art: :iphone: To format the project, we follow a responsive design , adapting it in high resolution with Flexbox and Grid. We also use Sass for the design.
